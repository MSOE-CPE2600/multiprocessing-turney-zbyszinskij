# System Programming Lab 11 Multiprocessing

## Implementation
The mandel.c file was changed so as to make 50 images instead of only one with the option to split the workload into numerous child processes

## Graph and Interpretation
![graph](https://vscode.dev/github/MSOE-CPE2600/multiprocessing-turney-zbyszinskij/blob/labWeek11/CPE2600Lab11Results.)

The graph shows that as the number of child processes increases, the ammount of time the program takes to run will decrease.
